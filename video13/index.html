    <blockquote>
        It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of
        deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is
        marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because
        there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great
        enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the
        triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his
        place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. — Theodore Roosevelt,
        "Citizenship in a Republic" speech (also known as "The Man in the Arena"), delivered at the Sorbonne, Paris,
        April 23, 1910

    <blockquote>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
        And sorry I could not travel both
        And be one traveler, long I stood
        And looked down one as far as I could
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;

        Then took the other, as just as fair,
        And having perhaps the better claim,
        Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
        Though as for that the passing there
        Had worn them really about the same,

        And both that morning equally lay
        In leaves no step had trodden black.
        Oh, I kept the first for another day!
        Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
        I doubted if I should ever come back.

        I shall be telling this with a sigh
        Somewhere ages and ages hence:
        Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
        I took the one less traveled by,
        And that has made all the difference."
        — Robert Frost, "The Road Not Taken"
